Peng Song
------------------

Peng Song is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). 
Prior to joining SUTD in 2019, he was a research scientist at EPFL, Switzerland. 
He received his PhD from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in 2013.
Pengâ€™s research interest is in computer graphics, with a particular focus on geometry modeling, computational design, and digital fabrication.
He has published over 30 research papers, including 10 SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH Asia technical papers and 1 Eurographics STAR paper on Computational Assemblies :cite:p:`Wang-2021-AssemblySurvey`.
He has served as a co-organizer of a weekly web series on Computational Fabrication :cite:p:`2021-CompFabSeminar`, and a program committee member of several leading conferences including SIGGRAPH Asia and Pacific Graphics.
Peng's research contribution is mainly in the field of Computational Assemblies.
He has proposed original computational solutions to understand, model, and design complex assemblies, including
interlocking assemblies :cite:p:`Song-2012-InterCubes, Fu-2015-Furniture, Wang-2018-DESIA`, 
reconfigurable assemblies :cite:p:`Song-2017-ReconfigInterlock, Tang-2019-3DDissection`, 
architectural assemblies :cite:p:`Song-2013-RFMadeEasy, Mellado-2014-RFAssembly, Wang-2019-TopoLock`, and
mechanical assemblies :cite:p:`Song-2017-Wind-upToy, Xu-2020-Non-CircularGears, Cheng-2021-3DCamDesign`.


Ziqi Wang 
-----------
Ziqi Wang recently finished his Ph.D. at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL. He received his bachelor degree in Mathematics in 2017 from the University of Science and Technology of China. His research focuses on geometry processing, architecture geometry, and digital fabrication. During his Ph.D., he studied the computational analysis and design of structurally stable assemblies with rigid parts. His proposed methods are used to generate globally interlocking assemblies :cite:p:`Song-2016-CofiFab, Wang-2018-DESIA`, topological interlocking assemblies :cite:p:`Wang-2019-TopoLock`,  and assemblies with cone-joints :cite:p:`Wang-2021-MOCCA`. Together with Prof. Peng Song and Prof. Mark Pauly, he has published a Eurographics STAR paper :cite:p:`Wang-2021-AssemblySurvey` that reviews the recent advancement in computational assemblies.


Marco Livesu
---------------------

is a tenured researcher at the National Research Council of Italy, where he works at the Institute for Applied Mathematics and Technological Information (CNR-IMATI). Prior to joining CNR, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia (Canada) and University of Cagliari (Italy), where he also obtained his PhD in 2014. His research is mostly focused on geometry processing for manufacturing and engineering applications. He regularly publishes in top tier computer graphics journals and conferences, including SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia, Eurographics and Symposium on Geometry Processing. He also serves as program committee member and reviewer for these and many other conferences and journals in the field. In 2015 he was the recipient of the Alain Bensoussan PostDoctoral Fellowship (ERCIM) and in 2021 he obtained the SGP Dataset Award for the HexaLab project :cite:p:`BTPLC18`. He is also the creator and lead developer of CinoLib :cite:p:`Liv19`, a C++ library for the processing of surface and volumetric meshes. He co-authored an EG STAR on 3D printing :cite:p:`Livesu-2017-3DModelsTo3DPrints`, a book that covers the whole digital manufacturing pipeline from design to fabrication :cite:p:`Attene-2018-DesignForAdditiveManufacturing` and various papers on related topics :cite:p:`Araujo-2019-Surface2Volume, Muntoni-2018-HeightFieldBlock,LCA18_extended`. In these works, he explored both additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques, as well as non-trivial combinations of those :cite:p:`TCAABLMMS20`.
