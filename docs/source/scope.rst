Scope
=====

.. _scope:

This tutorial requires some basic knowledge in computer graphics (e.g., shape representations, transformations) to understand how assemblies are represented, modelled, and designed in computers.

Scope
------

Assembly is a very broad concept.
According to their functionality, assemblies can be classified as **structures** that  transmit forces to carry loads and **mechanisms**  that transmit motion and forces to perform mechanical work.
This tutorial limits its scope to **structures with rigid parts**, focusing on four fundamental aspects, i.e., **parts fabricability**, **parts joining**, **assembly planning**, and **structural stability**. 
By assuming that the fabrication material is rigid, design of assemblies generally can be formulated as a geometric modeling and optimization problem, with minimal consideration of material behavior (e.g., friction).


Target Audience
-------------------------

This tutorial is aimed at two classes of audiences.
The first class is new graduate students in computer graphics, or more experienced researchers in other fields who are looking for an entry point into this exciting area.
The second class is designers and makers who are interested in making use of computational tools to create assembly designs that are impossible before.
At the end of the tutorial, we hope that people in the fist class are well equipped with the necessary knowledge to start independent research of their own in this area, and people in the second class know where to look and with whom to consult if they want to make use of research results to assist their design and fabrication process.
